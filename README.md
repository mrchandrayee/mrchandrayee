## About Me  

I’m a senior full-stack developer with **9+ years of hands-on, real-world experience** building production-grade systems across healthcare, fintech, AI platforms, marketplaces, and enterprise applications.

I specialize in building and evolving SaaS and web platforms — from early concepts and MVPs to mature, production-grade systems — designed to handle real users, real traffic, and real business operations.

My work focuses on **clean architecture, strong backend systems, and practical AI integrations**. I prioritize clarity, reliability, and long-term maintainability over shortcuts or trend-driven decisions.
