# Chand Rayee  
Senior Full-Stack Developer | AI/ML Engineer | Cloud Solutions Architect  
New Delhi, India  

## About Me  
I am a full-stack engineer with over eight years of experience designing and building reliable, scalable, and long-term software systems.  
My work spans across product engineering, AI-enabled platforms, large backend systems, and cloud infrastructure that supports real users and revenue-driven businesses.

Over the years, I’ve worked with:  
- DPT Hub Private Limited (Senior Software Engineer, 2023–Present)  
- Digital Promotion Team (AI Integration Specialist, 2021–2022)  
- Faskum Technologies (Full-Stack Developer, 2017–2020)

Across these roles, I’ve delivered production systems used by organizations in India and abroad — including SaaS platforms, AI-integrated applications, real-time communication tools, e-commerce solutions, and custom enterprise dashboards.

I focus on building software that continues to work reliably as the business grows: clean backend architecture, predictable deployments, structured APIs, straightforward UX, and cloud environments designed for long-term maintainability.

## Professional Strengths  

### Product Engineering  
I help teams turn product ideas into complete, stable platforms — from planning and architecture to development, testing, and production deployment.

### Backend, APIs & Systems  
I work extensively with Python, Django, FastAPI, Node.js, and microservice patterns to build secure, fast, and durable backend systems.

### Applied AI  
I integrate AI where it directly supports business goals: automated workflows, NLP systems, recommendation models, data extraction, document intelligence, and conversational interfaces.

### Cloud & Reliability  
Experience setting up AWS-based deployments, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, logs, error tracking, and ensuring systems remain available and cost-efficient.

### Long-Term Partnership  
Most of my professional work involves long-term collaboration with teams building complex platforms that evolve over months and years.
