# Chand Rayee  
### Senior Full-Stack Developer • AI/ML Engineer • Cloud Solutions Specialist

## About Me  
Hi, I’m **Chand**, a full-stack engineer with **8+ years of practical, hands-on experience** building real products for real businesses.

I’ve worked with:
- funded startups needing fast and stable development,
- small and mid-sized companies modernizing their systems,
- and global SaaS teams looking for long-term technical support.

My work is simple:  
**I build systems that stay reliable, scale smoothly, and make business operations easier.**

I focus on clear architecture, smooth user experience, secure backend systems, and cloud setups that run without breaking.

## 🔥 What I’m Good At

### **Building Complete Products**
Not just front-end, not just API —  
I take an idea and turn it into a fully working, well-structured application.

### **Practical AI Development**
Integrating AI where it actually makes sense:
- automation  
- chat systems  
- data processing  
- recommendations  
- real-time intelligence  

### **Backend Engineering That Scales**
I’ve built APIs and backend systems that handle real users, real traffic, and real business needs.

### **Cloud & Deployment**
Stable environments, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, logs, security —  
so teams can focus on business while the system quietly does its work.

### **Communication & Clarity**
I keep development clean, transparent, and predictable.  
Clients always know what’s happening and what’s next.
