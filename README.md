# Chand Rayee  
Senior Full-Stack Developer | AI/ML Engineer | Cloud Solutions Specialist  
New Delhi, India  

## About Me  
I am a full-stack engineer with more than eight years of experience helping businesses turn ideas into reliable, secure, and scalable digital products.  
My work spans across web applications, AI-powered solutions, backend systems, and cloud infrastructure designed to handle real users, real traffic, and real business operations.

I focus on building systems that are fast, structured, scalable, and easy to maintain. The goal is always the same:  
**build solutions that create measurable long-term value for the business.**

I work best with teams that need clear communication, consistent delivery, and engineering decisions based on stability and practicality rather than trends.
