# Chand Rayee  
Senior Full-Stack Developer | AI/ML Engineer | Cloud Solutions Architect

## About Me
I am Chand Rayee, a full-stack and AI-focused engineer with more than eight years of practical experience in designing, building, and maintaining production-grade systems.

My work spans across funded startups, mid-sized companies, and global SaaS teams. I specialize in taking a product from concept to a stable, scalable, and maintainable platform that can support real users and real business workflows.

I focus on long-term reliability, clean engineering, and predictable delivery. My approach is straightforward: understand the problem clearly, architect the right solution, and execute with consistency.

## What I Do
**Full Product Development**  
I build complete systems — frontend, backend, databases, and cloud deployment — with an emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and practical scalability.

**AI and Automation**  
I implement AI where it adds real value, such as automation, intelligent search, NLP-based systems, and workflow enhancements.

**Backend & API Engineering**  
I build structured, secure, and performant APIs designed for real production environments.

**Cloud & DevOps**  
I set up environments that run reliably: CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, logs, deployment systems, and cost-efficient cloud setups.

**Clear Communication**  
I keep the process transparent with clear expectations, progress updates, and straightforward discussion.
