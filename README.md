## About Me  

I’m a senior full-stack developer with **9+ years of real-world experience** building production-ready systems across healthcare, fintech, AI platforms, marketplaces, and enterprise applications.

I specialize in taking ideas, MVPs, or partially built products and turning them into **stable, secure, and scalable platforms** that support real users and real business workflows.

My focus is always on **clean architecture, backend reliability, and long-term maintainability** — not quick hacks or demo-only solutions.
