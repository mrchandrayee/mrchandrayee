# Chand Rayee  
Senior Full-Stack Developer | AI/ML Engineer | Cloud Solutions Architect  
New Delhi, India  

## About Me  
I am a full-stack engineer with more than eight years of hands-on experience in designing, building, and maintaining production-grade digital systems.  
My experience comes from working on long-term, complex products involving large backend infrastructures, AI-driven components, cloud environments, and end-to-end platform development.

I focus on delivering software that performs consistently in real-world conditions — where reliability, security, scalability, and clarity matter more than trends. Most of the platforms I build serve real users, handle transactional workloads, and support teams who rely on predictable system behavior.

Over the years, I’ve built projects across various industries including SaaS, digital automation, e-commerce, communication systems, AI-based applications, and cloud-native tools. I work best in environments that value thoughtful engineering and long-term maintainability.

## Professional Strengths  

### Product Engineering  
I work from the ground up — understanding the problem, defining the architecture, developing features, and preparing the system for long-term scaling.  
My focus is to take an idea from concept to a fully working, stable, production-ready solution.

### Backend, APIs & System Design  
I design clean backend architectures using Python, Django, FastAPI, and Node.js.  
My APIs are structured, secure, well-documented, and optimized for performance and clarity.  
I follow modular patterns that make systems easier to extend and maintain.

### Applied AI  
I use AI in practical, business-focused ways:  
text processing, search systems, embedding pipelines, automated workflows, chat interfaces, recommendation logic, and document intelligence.  
The goal is always practical improvement, not complexity.

### Cloud & Infrastructure  
I build cloud setups that are stable and predictable:  
CI/CD, monitoring, fault-handling, logs, backups, deployment pipelines, and cost-efficient infrastructure planning.  
My setups are designed to run continuously without surprise downtime.

### Long-Term Development Partnership  
I prefer long-term involvement with teams, ensuring systems evolve reliably as requirements grow.  
This includes continuous improvements, architecture updates, version upgrades, optimization, and scalable planning.
