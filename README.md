## About Me  

I am a senior full-stack developer with **9+ years of hands-on experience** building production-grade systems across healthcare, fintech, marketplaces, AI platforms, and enterprise applications.

I specialize in clean architecture, strong backend systems, and practical AI integrations. My approach prioritizes **clarity, reliability, and long-term maintainability** over shortcuts or trend-driven decisions.
